    "## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN's)\n",
    "Now that we've learned a little bit about how we can encode text it's time to dive into recurrent neural networks. Up until this point we have been using something called **feed-forward** neural networks. This simply means that all our data is fed forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. This was fine for the problems we considered before but won't work very well for processing text. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well this is exaclty what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop. A RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire input, one word at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we are treating our text data as a sequence! So that we can pass one word at a time to the RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at what a recurrent layer might look like.\n",

    "What this diagram is trying to illustrate is that a recurrent layer processes words or input one at a time in a combination with the output from the previous iteration. So, as we progress further in the input sequence, we build a more complex understanding of the text as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've just looked at is called a **simple RNN layer**. It can be effective at processing shorter sequences of text for simple problems but has many downfalls associated with it. One of them being the fact that as text sequences get longer it gets increasingly difficult for the network to understand the text properly.\n",

    "## LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)\n",
    "The layer we dicussed in depth above was called a *simpleRNN*. However, there does exist some other recurrent layers (layers that contain a loop) that work much better than a simple RNN layer. The one we will talk about here is called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This layer works very similarily to the simpleRNN layer but adds a way to access inputs from any timestep in the past. Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear. \n",
