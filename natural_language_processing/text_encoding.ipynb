    "## Encoding Text\n",

    "### Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and simplest way to encode our data is to use something called **bag of words**. This is a pretty easy technique where each word in a sentence is encoded with an integer and thrown into a collection that does not maintain the order of the words but does keep track of the frequency. Have a look at the python function below that encodes a string of text into bag of words. "

    "Much better, now we are keeping track of the order of words and we can tell where each occurs. But this still has a few issues with it. Ideally when we encode words, we would like similar words to have similar labels and different words to have very different labels. For example, the words happy and joyful should probably have very similar labels so we can determine that they are similar. While words like horrible and amazing should probably have very different labels. The method we looked at above won't be able to do something like this for us. This could mean that the model will have a very difficult time determing if two words are similar or not which could result in some pretty drastic performace impacts."
